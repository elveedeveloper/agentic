# Agentic Dev Workflow

Shared agentic-AI development workflow for **Node.js**, **.NET**, and **Next.js** repos. One source of truth lives here (`elveedeveloper/agentic`); product repos *consume* it via GitHub Actions `workflow_call` + a one-time bootstrap script. The big-company pattern, lightweight enough to run today.

If you're starting fresh: skip to [Quick starts](#quick-starts).
If you already have a real repo: skip to [Adopt on an existing repo](#adopt-on-an-existing-repo).
If you just want to drive Claude on your own machine with no GitHub Actions: skip to [Local-only](#local-only--use-on-your-machine-without-github-actions).

## Current state — what's shipped, what's next

| Phase | What it adds | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Shared-config infrastructure: reusable `ci-dotnet` workflow + `init-claude-config.ps1` + `docs/consumer-setup.md` + Tier-2 (.NET-only) review/pr-bot reusable workflows | ✅ Merged |
| **1.5** | Cleanup: removed `apps/hello` test-bed so Agentic is pure shared-config | ✅ Merged |
| **2** | First real .NET consumer: `elveedeveloper/calculator-api`. CI green via `reusable-ci-dotnet.yml@main` | ✅ Live |
| **3a (Node side)** | Node reusable CI workflow + Node stack support in init script + first Node consumer `elveedeveloper/calculator-api-node` + EL-209 story end-to-end | ✅ Merged |
| **3a (Jira intake)** | Real Jira ticket (`EL-209`) pulled via Atlassian MCP, plan-gated, implemented, reviewed, draft PR, merged | ✅ Merged |
| **3b (autonomous infra)** | Reusable `claude-from-jira-node.yml` + `-WithFromJira` init flag — Node consumers can now get autonomous draft PRs from Jira labels | ✅ Merged (PR #7) |
| **Jira-on-merge infra** | Reusable `jira-on-merge.yml` + `-WithJiraSync` init flag — auto-transition Jira ticket to `Done` when PR merges | 🟡 PR #6 draft, awaiting review |
| **4 (recommended next)** | Live-fire Tier-2 autonomous on a real Jira ticket: wire secrets + Jira automation rule on `calculator-api-node`, label a small ticket `agent-ready`, watch the draft PR appear, capture a first-run report | ⏭️ Next |
| **5** | Stack parity: `reusable-claude-from-jira-dotnet.yml` so `calculator-api` joins the autonomous flow + Node Tier-2 review/pr-bot variants | Future |
| **6** | Production guardrails: CODEOWNERS, branch protection, tag pinning, Anthropic budget alerts | Future |

What you can actually **do today** with what's merged:

- ✅ Stand up a new .NET or Node consumer in under 5 minutes and have it run shared CI.
- ✅ Drive any ticket through a local Tier-1 loop (Claude Code on your machine, agent uses Atlassian MCP for ticket intake).
- ✅ Enable autonomous Tier-2 from Jira → draft PR on Node consumers (after wiring secrets + Jira automation rule).
- 🟡 Auto-transition Jira tickets to Done on merge — *not yet* (PR #6 in flight).
- 🟡 Tier-2 review/pr-bot on Node consumers — *not yet* (.NET only so far).

## Where do agents run?

Two distinct locations, two distinct purposes. Most teams use both.

### Local — Tier 1 (you drive)

You open **Claude Code** in your repo, ask it to pick up a ticket, and watch it work. The agent runs on **your machine**. Plan-mode gates surface in your terminal. You approve, edit, or reject before any code lands.

- **Where the work happens:** your laptop / dev VM.
- **Where the API call goes:** Anthropic's API. The agent sends your prompts, file contents in the working set, and tool calls.
- **Where the output lands:** your local git repo, then `git push` to GitHub.
- **What it costs:** Anthropic API tokens for what *you* asked it to do.
- **Best for:** day-to-day feature work, debugging, exploration. Anything you'd want to watch and steer.

### Pipeline — Tier 2 (you're not there)

The same agent, running inside **GitHub Actions** on a Linux runner, triggered by repo events. No human in the loop until the PR review.

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude-review.yml` | PR open / synchronize / ready-for-review | Posts an automated `/review` + `/security-review` comment on the PR |
| `claude-pr-bot.yml` | `@claude` comment on a PR | Wakes Claude to address the comment — push code, answer, or both |
| `claude-from-jira.yml` | Jira label `agent-ready` → `repository_dispatch` | Opens a draft PR from scratch based on the Jira ticket |
| `jira-on-merge.yml` | PR `closed` with `merged=true` | Auto-transitions matched Jira tickets to `Done` |

- **Where the work happens:** GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner (default) or a self-hosted runner if you set one up.
- **Where the API call goes:** Anthropic's API from the runner. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a GitHub repo secret.
- **Where the output lands:** a branch on your GitHub repo, pushed by the runner's PAT or `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **What it costs:** Anthropic API tokens (per-fire) + GitHub Actions minutes. A typical small ticket end-to-end is ~$0.50–$3 in API spend.
- **Best for:** async work that doesn't need your eyes — review-on-open, dependency bumps, after-hours weekend tickets, Jira-driven feature flags. Anything where the human review gate at the *end* of the PR is what matters, not the *start*.

### Best practice — the hybrid model

Most teams that get value from this run **Tier-1 by default, Tier-2 selectively**:

1. Day 1 → Day 90: Tier-1 only. Build muscle memory. Tune `CLAUDE.md` and hooks against your team's actual style.
2. Day 90+: Enable `claude-review.yml` on one repo. Low risk, high signal — comments only, no code pushes.
3. Day 120+: Add `claude-pr-bot.yml` so reviewers can ask `@claude` to fix linting / write a test / explain a hunk.
4. Day 180+ (or never, if you don't need it): `claude-from-jira.yml` for narrow, well-specified ticket types only — dependency bumps, lint fixes, doc updates. Generalist autonomous PRs amplify the agent's worst habits.

Anthropic's hosted alternative — **Claude Code action on a managed runner with no infra** — is what `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` is. You don't need a self-hosted runner; GitHub's default `ubuntu-latest` works. Self-hosted runners only matter if your code has compliance constraints that forbid running on shared infra.

For the rare team that wants a **fully managed always-on agent** (no GitHub Actions plumbing), Cognition's **Devin** is the comparable commercial product (~$500/mo per seat). What this repo gives you is the same shape, on your own infra, configurable.

## Two consumption modes

| Mode | What you do | When to pick |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A — Drop-in** | Copy `templates/<stack>/` into your repo by hand | One-off experiment; you don't care about future updates |
| **B — Shared (recommended)** | Run `init-claude-config.ps1`. Consumer keeps local copies of `CLAUDE.md` + hooks (offline-friendly, per-repo editable); CI logic stays shared via `workflow_call` | Any real repo. Updates to CI flow from one place to all consumers. |

The rest of this README assumes **Mode B**. Mode A is documented in `docs/consumer-setup.md` for reference.

---

## Quick starts

You need: **Claude Code** installed + authenticated, **Git**, **`gh` CLI** authenticated, your stack's toolchain (Node 22+ / .NET 8+ / etc.), and a **local clone of this repo**.

### Quick start — New Node.js + TypeScript project

```powershell
# 1. Create the new GitHub repo (private) + clone alongside Agentic
cd d:\path\to\your-org-repos
gh repo create your-org/your-new-node-app --private --clone

# 2. Scaffold the Node + TS bones (skip if you're starting from an existing project)
cd your-new-node-app
npm init -y
# Drop in your source layout: src/, tests/, .nvmrc with node 22.13.0, etc.

# 3. Wire up agentic shared config
cd d:\path\to\Agentic
.\scripts\init-claude-config.ps1 `
    -Target d:\path\to\your-org-repos\your-new-node-app `
    -Stack node

# 4. Resolve <<EDIT ME>> placeholders in the new CLAUDE.md (search for the markers)
# 5. Add a .gitattributes for LF normalization (see docs/consumer-setup.md "EOL gotcha")

# 6. First commit + push
cd d:\path\to\your-org-repos\your-new-node-app
git add CLAUDE.md .claude .github/workflows/
git commit -m "chore: bootstrap agentic dev workflow"
git push
```

First push triggers CI; you should see the `check` job report *"Called workflow: elveedeveloper/agentic/.github/workflows/reusable-ci-node.yml@main"*. That's the shared CI in action.

Working examples: [`elveedeveloper/calculator-api-node`](https://github.com/elveedeveloper/calculator-api-node).

### Quick start — New .NET 8 project

```powershell
# 1. Create the new GitHub repo (private) + clone
cd d:\path\to\your-org-repos
gh repo create your-org/your-new-dotnet-app --private --clone

# 2. Scaffold .NET 8 (do this BEFORE wiring agentic so global.json drives the new dotnet commands)
cd your-new-dotnet-app
'{ "sdk": { "version": "8.0.400", "rollForward": "latestFeature" } }' | Out-File -Encoding utf8 global.json
dotnet new gitignore
dotnet new editorconfig
dotnet new sln -n YourApp
dotnet new web   -n YourApp.Api       -o src/YourApp.Api       --framework net8.0
dotnet new xunit -n YourApp.Api.Tests -o tests/YourApp.Api.Tests --framework net8.0
dotnet sln YourApp.sln add src/YourApp.Api/YourApp.Api.csproj tests/YourApp.Api.Tests/YourApp.Api.Tests.csproj
dotnet add tests/YourApp.Api.Tests/YourApp.Api.Tests.csproj reference src/YourApp.Api/YourApp.Api.csproj
dotnet add tests/YourApp.Api.Tests/YourApp.Api.Tests.csproj package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing --version "8.0.*"

# 3. Directory.Build.props (nullable, warnings-as-errors) — see templates/dotnet/Directory.Build.props.example

# 4. Wire up agentic shared config
cd d:\path\to\Agentic
.\scripts\init-claude-config.ps1 `
    -Target d:\path\to\your-org-repos\your-new-dotnet-app `
    -Stack dotnet

# 5. Resolve <<EDIT ME>> placeholders in CLAUDE.md
# 6. Set end_of_line = lf in .editorconfig (see docs/consumer-setup.md "EOL gotcha")

# 7. First commit + push
cd d:\path\to\your-org-repos\your-new-dotnet-app
git add CLAUDE.md .claude .github/workflows/ global.json .gitignore .gitattributes Directory.Build.props YourApp.sln src tests
git commit -m "chore: bootstrap agentic dev workflow"
git push
```

Working example: [`elveedeveloper/calculator-api`](https://github.com/elveedeveloper/calculator-api).

### Quick start — New Next.js project

Reusable CI for Next.js is **not yet implemented**. Path A: use the drop-in template (`templates/nextjs/`) for now. Path B: add `reusable-ci-nextjs.yml` first, similar to `reusable-ci-node.yml`. The CLAUDE.md + hooks are already present in `templates/nextjs/`.

If you go path A:

```powershell
cd d:\path\to\your-new-nextjs-app

# Drop in template files
copy d:\path\to\Agentic\templates\nextjs\CLAUDE.md .
xcopy d:\path\to\Agentic\templates\nextjs\.claude .claude\ /E /I
xcopy d:\path\to\Agentic\templates\nextjs\.github .github\ /E /I

# Resolve placeholders, commit, push.
```

### Adopt on an existing repo

The hard mode — your repo already has CI, ESLint, eslint config, etc. Don't blindly overwrite anything.

**Step 1 — Pick your smallest, lowest-risk repo.** Library, internal tool, low-traffic service. The first adoption is about learning friction, not shipping features.

**Step 2 — Run the init script with conservative defaults:**

```powershell
.\scripts\init-claude-config.ps1 `
    -Target d:\path\to\existing-repo `
    -Stack <node|dotnet|nextjs>
```

By default it **skips** any file that already exists. It will:
- Create `CLAUDE.md` only if not already present.
- Create `.claude/` only if not already present.
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` only if not already present.

If your repo already has a `CLAUDE.md`, the init won't touch it. Merge new content from `templates/<stack>/CLAUDE.md` by hand — *don't* lose your repo-specific conventions.

**Step 3 — Reconcile CI conflicts.** Most existing repos have `.github/workflows/ci.yml` already. Four options:

| Option | When |
| --- | --- |
| **Rename the new file** to `claude-ci.yml` and let both run | Simplest; some duplicate compute |
| **Merge** the agentic CI step into your existing `ci.yml` | Cleaner long-term; more work |
| **Skip** the agentic CI entirely | Your existing CI already runs `npm run check` / `dotnet test` |
| **Delete the generated `ci.yml`** and stay local-only | You don't want any pipeline integration yet — see [Local-only](#local-only--use-on-your-machine-without-github-actions) below |

The shared-config CI is the *safety net*. Local hooks are what actually enforce per-commit. You can adopt CLAUDE.md + hooks without touching your CI at all.

**Step 4 — Reconcile other tooling.** `.editorconfig`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `package.json` scripts — these are **repo-owned**. The init script does not touch them. If the hooks reference commands that don't exist (e.g. `npm run check`), either:
- Add the script to `package.json` (preferred — `check` is a meaningful name).
- Or edit `.claude/hooks/guard-commit.mjs` to call your existing command.

**Step 5 — Smoke test.** Open Claude Code in the existing repo, give it a tiny ticket (typo fix, doc update, one-function helper). Drive end-to-end. Capture a first-run report ([example](docs/first-run-report.md)). Tune **before** running a second ticket.

**Step 6 — Roll out.** Once one repo works cleanly for 5–10 stories, adopt the next one. Don't enable Tier-2 on more than one repo until you've felt the Tier-1 friction first.

---

### Local-only — use on your machine without GitHub Actions

You don't need a pipeline to get most of the value. The agent contract, the per-edit hooks, and the pre-commit gate all run **entirely on your laptop** through Claude Code. You can adopt that today, on any existing repo, without touching CI, without adding GitHub secrets, and without your team noticing.

**What you get locally:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — the agent reads this at startup; it's your stack conventions + commands + out-of-scope paths.
- `.claude/hooks/guard-secrets.*` — fires on every `Edit / Write / MultiEdit`, blocks AWS keys, PATs, private-key blocks.
- `.claude/hooks/guard-commit.*` — fires before every `git commit`, runs your `check`/`test` script, blocks red commits.
- `.claude/settings.json` — permissions (which Bash commands the agent can run unprompted) + hook bindings.
- Atlassian MCP for Jira intake — also a **local** setup inside Claude Code (`/mcp` → authenticate), nothing in GitHub required.

**What you skip:**
- No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in repo settings — Claude Code uses your local auth.
- No Tier-2 workflows, no `claude-review.yml`, no `claude-from-jira.yml`.
- No `jira-on-merge.yml` — close Jira tickets the way you do today.

**Steps:**

```powershell
# 1. Run init as usual
.\scripts\init-claude-config.ps1 `
    -Target d:\path\to\existing-repo `
    -Stack <node|dotnet|nextjs>

# 2. Delete the generated CI shim — you're not using it
cd d:\path\to\existing-repo
Remove-Item .github\workflows\ci.yml

# 3. Resolve every <<EDIT ME>> placeholder in CLAUDE.md
#    (stack version, repo name, commands, out-of-scope paths)

# 4. Make sure the command in guard-commit.* exists in your repo
#    Node:   `npm run check` — add to package.json scripts if missing
#    .NET:   `dotnet format && dotnet build && dotnet test`
#    Edit .claude/hooks/guard-commit.* to call whatever your repo actually uses.

# 5. Commit just the agentic bits — nothing about CI changes
git add CLAUDE.md .claude
git commit -m "chore: adopt agentic local config"
```

**Daily use as a developer:**

1. Open Claude Code in the repo (`claude` in the terminal at the repo root).
2. Give it a task in plain English, or paste a Jira key (e.g. *"work on EL-217"*) if you've connected the Atlassian MCP.
3. The agent reads `CLAUDE.md`, enters plan mode, shows you the plan. **You approve** before any edits land — this is the first human gate.
4. As it edits, the secret-scan hook fires on every write. If the commit script is red, the commit hook blocks it. You see the failure and either fix it or tell the agent to.
5. When it's done, you `git push` and open a PR through your normal process. Review the diff like any other PR.

That's it. No runner, no secret, no workflow. Tier-2 (review-on-open, autonomous-from-Jira) is a strict *addition* you can wire in later when you want async work; it doesn't change anything about how the local loop works.

**When you outgrow local-only:** once Tier-1 has been smooth for ~5–10 stories and you want hands-off review or after-hours Jira tickets, jump back to [Two consumption modes](#two-consumption-modes) and follow the pipeline path. The local files you already have don't change — you just add a `.github/workflows/` shim and a couple of repo secrets.

## Where to tune code quality

Four distinct layers, in order from "vague guidance" to "hard enforcement". When something feels off, ask "which layer is the right fix?"

### 1. `CLAUDE.md` — the contract

What the agent reads at startup. Tell it your stack conventions, your commands, your out-of-scope paths. Per-repo file. Edit freely.

| If you want to... | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Change which test runner the agent assumes | The "Stack" section |
| Add a new "must" rule (e.g. "all DB queries go through `db/client.ts`") | "Repository conventions" |
| Forbid the agent from touching a path | "Out of scope for the agent" |
| Make the agent always TDD a specific module | "How the agent should work in this repo" |

**Limit:** 200 lines. Past that, you're trying to encode taste — move it to enforcement (next layer) or human review.

### 2. `.claude/settings.json` — permissions + hook bindings

What tools the agent is allowed to use, and which hooks fire on which tool calls. Per-repo. Hard rules (the agent literally cannot do what's in `deny`).

| If you want to... | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Allow a new shell command without prompting | `permissions.allow` (use specific patterns like `Bash(npm:*)`) |
| Block a dangerous command | `permissions.deny` (e.g. `Bash(rm -rf:*)`) |
| Make a new hook fire on every `Edit` | `hooks.PreToolUse` block |
| Add a forbidden-paths rule | A new hook that exits 2 when a `forbidden/` write is attempted |

### 3. `.claude/hooks/*` — enforcement scripts

The hooks themselves. Per-repo files. These actually run and pass/fail.

| File | When it fires | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `guard-commit.mjs` (Node) / `.ps1` (.NET) | Before any `Bash(git commit:*)` | Runs the full `npm run check` / `dotnet format && build && test` — blocks if anything fails |
| `guard-secrets.mjs` (Node) / `.ps1` (.NET) | Before any `Edit / Write / MultiEdit` | Scans the new content for AWS keys, GitHub PATs, private key blocks, etc. — blocks if found |
| `guard-pages-router.mjs` (Next.js only) | Before file writes under `pages/` | Blocks new pages-router files in App-Router-only repos |

Customize by editing the script. New regex for new secret types, new path patterns, new conditions.

### 4. Stack tooling — the real quality gate

The agent obeys what the toolchain says. Strict TypeScript, Roslyn analyzers, ESLint, Prettier. **These do the heavy lifting.** Per-repo, edit per the toolchain's docs.

| If you want to... | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Forbid `any` in TypeScript | `eslint.config.js` rules + `tsconfig.json` `noImplicitAny` |
| Forbid `var` for primitives (.NET) | An analyzer config in `Directory.Build.props` |
| Enforce 100% test coverage on changed files | CI workflow + coverage tool config (coverlet / vitest) |
| Make every PR run an a11y check (Next.js) | Add a Playwright + `axe-core` step in CI |

**Rule of thumb:** if you can express it as a lint rule or compiler flag, do that. Then `CLAUDE.md` only needs to say *"the codebase enforces X via the linter"* — the agent will respect it because the linter will reject otherwise.

For deep-dive patterns, see [docs/hooks-cookbook.md](docs/hooks-cookbook.md) and [docs/best-practices.md](docs/best-practices.md).

## Prereqs

- [**Claude Code**](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and authenticated.
- **Git**.
- [**GitHub `gh` CLI**](https://cli.github.com/) authenticated to your GitHub account.
- **Atlassian MCP connector** authenticated inside Claude Code (run `/mcp`, select `claude.ai Atlassian`, complete the browser flow). Only needed for Jira intake.
- Your stack toolchain: Node 22+, .NET 8+, or whatever your stack requires.

## Secrets cheat sheet

Add at **Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** on each consumer.

| Secret | Required for | Where to get it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | All Tier-2 workflows | Anthropic Console → Settings → API keys → Create Key |
| `PR_BOT_TOKEN` | `claude-pr-bot.yml` (optional but recommended) | GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens. Scope: this repo. Perms: `Contents: Read & write` + `Pull requests: Read & write` |
| `JIRA_DISPATCH_PAT` | `claude-from-jira.yml` (optional but recommended) | Same as `PR_BOT_TOKEN` — separate token so revocation is granular |
| `JIRA_BASE_URL` | `jira-on-merge.yml` | e.g. `https://elvee.atlassian.net` (no trailing slash) |
| `JIRA_USER_EMAIL` | `jira-on-merge.yml` | The Atlassian account whose API token will sign requests |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | `jira-on-merge.yml` | https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens → Create API token |

And one PAT that lives **inside Jira** (not GitHub) on the automation rule that fires `repository_dispatch`: a fine-grained GitHub PAT with `metadata:read` + `contents:read` on the target consumer repo. See [docs/consumer-setup.md](docs/consumer-setup.md#jira-automation-rule-one-per-jira-project) for the full Jira automation recipe.

---

## Versioning

Reusable workflows default to `@main` in generated consumer shims:

```yaml
uses: elveedeveloper/agentic/.github/workflows/reusable-ci-node.yml@main
```

Easy mode. Risky once you have 3+ consumers (a bad commit to Agentic main breaks all CIs at once).

When you have 3+ consumer repos:

1. In Agentic, tag a release: `git tag -a v1 -m "First stable" && git push origin v1`.
2. Re-run the init script per consumer with `-AgenticRef v1`.
3. Updates require a deliberate `-AgenticRef v2` per-repo bump.

`anthropics/claude-code-action` itself is pinned to `@v1` in our reusable workflows with a `# VERIFY current tag` comment — check the [action's releases](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) before depending on this in production.
